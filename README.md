## 🤖 What is this?
The original RVC WebUI is hard to install and requires complex Python knowledge.

### ✨ Features
- **50+ Pre-installed Models**: Biden, Trump, Anime Girls, SpongeBob, Kratos, and more.
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for gaming ( < 50ms delay).
- **Noise Suppression**: AI-driven background noise removal.
- **Auto-Config**: Automatically detects your Microphone and Headphones.
